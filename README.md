# Melbourne-Housing-Market

Project completed as part of the York U Big Data Analytics Certification. The aim of this project is to build machine learning models. As part of this project I completed an exploratory data analysis, complete with multiple visualizations. Additionally, I dealt with missing data in important fields by learning and employing new imputation techniques. For this project I utilized both regression and classification models. As the project progresses I will be adding in better cross validation.
